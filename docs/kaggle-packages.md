# Kaggle Packages Documentation

## Overview

Kaggle Packages is a feature that allows us to create reusable machine learning models as Python libraries. For our text-to-SVG competition, all submissions must be made as Kaggle Packages with specific requirements.

This document summarizes key information from the [official Kaggle Packages documentation](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/packages).

## Package Structure

### Core Components

A Kaggle Package must include:

1. **Model Class**: A Python class that implements the core functionality
2. **predict() Method**: The required interface method that will be called during evaluation
3. **Dependencies**: Clearly defined package requirements

### Basic Example

```python
class Model:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize resources, models, or other components
        pass
        
    def predict(self, prompt):
        """
        Generate SVG code from a text description
        
        Args:
            prompt (str): Text description of the image to generate
            
        Returns:
            str: Valid SVG code rendering the described image
        """
        # Implementation logic here
        return svg_code
